K Means Clustering


Details:

•	Clustering is used for grouping data into different buckets with similar characteristics
•	Clustering is implemented in directly tableau or tableau connected through R
•	Optimal number of clusters are determined based on elbow method or there are many ways out there
•	In K means clustering number of clusters are pre-defined and input into model
•	Cluster package in R does this in R

Applications:

There are various application of Clustering in Test and Learn

1.	Applied it to find out Outliers in data
2.	Applied to group DMA into various clusters and randomly select DMAs from each cluster to split data into required cohorts
3.	Applied to group stores into various clusters

Finding the Optimal number of Clusters for K means Clustering Method

There are various method to find the optimal number of clusters, Elbow method is the popular method used mostly.

Example:

Data:

R code:
